ABSTRACT = {Extreme heat exposure has severe negative impacts on humans, and the issue is exacerbated by climate change. Estimating spatial heat stress such as mean radiant temperature (MRT) is currently difficult to apply at city scale. This study constructed a method for estimating the MRT of street canyons using Google Street View (GSV) images and investigated its large-scale spatial patterns at street level. We used image segmentation using deep learning to calculate the view factor (VF) and project panorama into fisheye images. We calculated sun paths to estimate MRT using panorama images from Google Street View. This paper shows that regression analysis can be used to validate between estimated short-wave, long-wave radiation and the measurement data at seven field measurements in the clear-sky (0.97 and 0.77, respectively). Additionally, we compared the calculated MRT and land surface temperature (LST) from Landsat 8 on a city scale. As a result of investigating spatial patterns of MRT in Seoul, South Korea, we found that a high MRT of street canyons (&gt;59.4 &deg;C) is mainly distributed in open space areas and compact low-rise density buildings where the sky view factor is 0.6&ndash;1.0 and the building view factor (BVF) is 0.35&ndash;0.5, or west-east oriented street canyons with an SVF of 0.3&ndash;0.55. However, high-density buildings (BVF: 0.4&ndash;0.6) or high-density tree areas (Tree View Factor, TVF: 0.6&ndash;0.99) showed low MRT (&lt;47.6). The mapped MRT results had a similar spatial distribution to the LST; however, the MRT was lower than the LST in low tree density or low-rise high-density building areas. The method proposed in this study is suitable for a complex urban environment consisting of buildings, trees, and streets. This will help decision makers understand spatial patterns of heat stress at the street level.},

abstract = {This study presents a method for calculating solar irradiance of street canyons using Google Street View (GSV) images and investigates its spatiotemporal patterns in a high-density urban environment. In this method, GSV images provide a unique way to characterize the street morphology from which the diurnal solar path and solar radiation exposure can be estimated in a street canyon. Verifications of our developed method using free-horizon HKO observations and street-level field measurements show that both the calculated clear-sky and all-sky solar irradiance of street canyons well capture the diurnal and seasonal cycles. In the high-density urban areas of Hong Kong, we found that (1) the lowest monthly averaged solar irradiations in winter are 6.6 (December) and 4.6 (February) MJ/m2/day, and the highest values in summer are 17.3 (July) and 10.8 (June) MJ/m2/day for clear-sky and all-sky calculations, respectively; (2) The spatial variability of solar irradiation is closely related to sky view factor (SVF). In summer, the irradiation in a low-rise region (SVF≥0.7) on average is about three times that in a high-rise region (SVF≤0.3), and they differ by about five times in winter; (3) Street orientation has a significant impact on the solar radiation received in a high-density street canyon. In general, street canyons with West-East orientation receive higher solar irradiation during summer and lower during winter compared to those with South-North orientation. The generated maps of street-level solar irradiation may help researchers investigate the interactions between solar radiation, human health and urban thermal balance in high-density urban environments.}

ABSTRACT = {Hemispherical (fisheye) photography is a well-established approach for estimating the sky view factor (SVF). High-resolution urban models from LiDAR and oblique airborne photogrammetry can provide continuous SVF estimates over a large urban area, but such data are not always available and are difficult to acquire. Street view panoramas have become widely available in urban areas worldwide: Google Street View (GSV) maintains a global network of panoramas excluding China and several other countries; Baidu Street View (BSV) and Tencent Street View (TSV) focus their panorama acquisition efforts within China, and have covered hundreds of cities therein. In this paper, we approach this issue from a big data perspective by presenting and validating a method for automatic estimation of SVF from massive amounts of street view photographs. Comparisons were made with SVF estimates derived from two independent sources: a LiDAR-based Digital Surface Model (DSM) and an oblique airborne photogrammetry-based 3D city model (OAP3D), resulting in a correlation coefficient of 0.863 and 0.987, respectively. The comparisons demonstrated the capacity of the proposed method to provide reliable SVF estimates. Additionally, we present an application of the proposed method with about 12,000 GSV panoramas to characterize the spatial distribution of SVF over Manhattan Island in New York City. Although this is a proof-of-concept study, it has shown the potential of the proposed approach to assist urban climate and urban planning research. However, further development is needed before this approach can be finally delivered to the urban climate and urban planning communities for practical applications.},

abstract = {The variability of urban landscapes and weather conditions makes it challenging to quantify the solar radiation of urban streets. In this study, we propose a framework to map and profile the street-level solar radiation using Baidu Street View (BSV) images. In our framework, a BSV-based radiation estimation method considering weather conditions is established to map the hourly street-level solar radiation. Then, a two-stage clustering method is proposed to profile the radiation patterns, including daily radiation patterns (DRP) and multifaceted radiation patterns (MRP), from the estimated radiation data. Taking Chongqing as a case, results show that (1) the estimated solar radiation of the proposed method is closer to the real situation than the two existing methods. (2) The solar radiation of streets varies greatly among different road grades and streetscapes; the street environment and weather conditions have a significant impact on solar radiation in mountain cities. (3) Eight types of DRP and six types of MRP are discovered by the two-stage clustering method. Moreover, the features, geographical distribution and applications of the radiation patterns are investigated in detail to support urban planning. This work can greatly promote studies relating the solar radiation at the street-level in the future.}

abstract = {Building smart cities requires three-dimensional (3D) modelling to facilitate the planning and management of built environments. This requirement leads to high demand for data on vertical dimensions, such as building height, that are critical for the construction of 3D city models. Despite increasing recognition of the importance of such data, their acquisition in a low-cost and efficient manner remains a daunting task. Big data, particularly street view images (SVIs), provide an opportunity to efficiently solve this problem. In this study, we aim to derive information on building height from openly available SVIs by using single view metrology. Unlike other methods using multisource inputs, our method capitalizes on deep neural networks to extract a set of features – such as vanishing points, line segments, and semantic segmentation maps – for single view measurement and then estimates the height from single SVIs. The minimal input required by the method increases its competitiveness in large-scale estimation of building heights, especially in areas with difficulty to obtain the conventional remote sensing data. In addition to experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method, we also conduct a thorough analysis of uncertainties and errors brought by the method, thereby providing guidance for its future applications.1Source code: https://github.com/yzre/SIHE.}
